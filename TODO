BUGS:
[ ] Detaching tab causes weird stuff
	- Detecting onDetached and onAttached events isn't enough. Still fires other events.
	- Maybe passing undefined into saveTime for onDetached?
	- Doesn't seem too much of an issue? When reattached, current URL is correct?
- [ ] Clicking on different tab while unfocused causes two events to fire simutaneously. 
- [x] Error checking for updateTime()
- [x] Opening link in new tab causes that tab to be "current" one, even if it isn't
- [x] chrome://newtab and loaded site are different
- [x] web.archive.org links match to 2nd http instead of 1st


TESTS:
- Go to new page from current page
- Switch between tabs normally
- Switch from focused to unfocused to focused
- Switch from unfocused to different tab (not active tab)
- Switch between windows
- Open new page in different tab
	- Wait for other page to load, then visit it
	- Go to other page while loading, then wait
	- Go to other page while loading, then switch back to original page before it finishes loading
- Detach then reattach tab
- Close chrome w/ one tab open
- Close chrome w/ multiple tabs open
- Close chrome, wait >1 min, then reopen
