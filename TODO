BUGS:

	- Doesn't seem to matter too much, just causes a lot of events to fire off
- [x] Clicking on different tab while unfocused causes two events to fire simutaneously. 
- [x] Error checking for updateTime()
- [x] Opening link in new tab causes that tab to be "current" one, even if it isn't
- [x] chrome://newtab and loaded site are different
- [x] web.archive.org links match to 2nd http instead of 1st
